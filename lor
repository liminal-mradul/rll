To the Selection Committee of the Research Science Institute,
I am writing to strongly recommend Mradul Umrao for admission to RSI. I taught him Computer Science in Grades 9 and 10 and have closely observed his growth since. In that time, Mradul has evolved from a capable student into an intellectually independent thinker with genuine research inclination.
In the classroom, Mradul consistently exceeded syllabus expectations. Rather than simply completing assignments correctly, he questioned underlying logic, explored alternative approaches, and sought structural clarity over surface-level answers. This intellectual curiosity set him apart early on.
Beyond the classroom, he independently pursued advanced computing concepts, and our conversations naturally shifted from textbook exercises to discussions on system design, algorithmic efficiency, and emerging technologies. This progression reflects authentic curiosity and disciplined self-motivation.
I recently took Mradul to a Generative AI workshop alongside older, more advanced learners. He engaged confidently, asked technically sharp questions, and the workshop lecturer personally remarked on his depth of understanding. He was clearly not just absorbing information but critically analyzing it.
Mradul also demonstrates intellectual persistence and humility. He breaks down difficult problems methodically, revisits ideas until achieving clarity, and remains open to feedback. Peers frequently seek his help, and he explains concepts with patience and precision.
I recommend Mradul without reservation. He has the analytical depth, curiosity, and maturity to thrive at RSI and contribute meaningfully to its community.
Sincerely,

To the Selection Committee of the Research Science Institute,
It is my pleasure to recommend Mradul Umrao for admission to RSI. As his Mathematics teacher, I have had the opportunity to observe him not just as a student, but as a young thinker whose abilities go considerably deeper than his academic record reflects.
I will be straightforward: Mradul's marks have not always been at the top of the class. But in my years of teaching, I have learned to distinguish between students who perform and students who think, and Mradul firmly belongs to the latter category. There is a sharpness to the way he engages with problems that is immediately noticeable. He picks up on patterns quickly, challenges assumptions, and often reaches the core of a problem before his peers have finished reading it.
What strikes me most is how naturally he gravitates toward ideas. In classroom discussions, he does not wait to be called upon. He engages, proposes, and questions with a spontaneity that reflects genuine intellectual excitement. This same quality carries into his approach to innovation. He is not interested in reproducing existing solutions. He wants to understand why they work and whether something better is possible.
Outside the classroom, Mradul has been a notably active participant in extracurricular pursuits. He brings initiative and originality to everything he takes on, and his presence in any group setting is one that elevates the quality of thinking around him.
RSI looks for students who are ready to do real research, not just repeat what they have been taught. Mradul is exactly that kind of student. I recommend him with genuine enthusiasm.
Sincerely,
Saurabh Sharma

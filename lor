To the Selection Committee of the Research Science Institute,

I am writing to strongly recommend [Student Name] for admission to RSI. I taught [him/her/them] Computer Science in Grades 9 and 10 and have continued to observe [his/her/their] academic growth closely over the years. During this time, I have seen [Student Name] evolve from a capable student of the school curriculum into an intellectually independent thinker with genuine research inclination.

In the classroom, [Student Name] consistently demonstrated a depth of understanding that exceeded syllabus expectations. While many students focus on completing assignments correctly, [he/she/they] approached topics by questioning underlying logic and structure. Whether we were studying algorithms, programming fundamentals, or problem-solving techniques, [he/she/they] regularly explored alternative methods and asked why certain approaches were more efficient than others. This habit of seeking structural clarity rather than surface-level correctness distinguished [him/her/them] early on.

What has impressed me most, however, is [Student Name]’s intellectual growth over time. After completing my formal course, [he/she/they] continued independently exploring advanced computing concepts beyond the school curriculum. I have witnessed [his/her/their] transition from learning concepts to actively experimenting with them. Our conversations gradually shifted from textbook exercises to discussions about system design, algorithmic efficiency, and emerging technologies. This steady progression reflects maturity, discipline, and authentic curiosity rather than short-term academic ambition.

Recently, I had the opportunity to take [Student Name] to a Generative AI workshop conducted by external experts. In that setting, surrounded by older students and advanced learners, [he/she/they] engaged confidently with the material. More importantly, [he/she/they] asked thoughtful technical questions that demonstrated real conceptual engagement. The workshop lecturer personally remarked on [Student Name]’s clarity of understanding and depth of inquiry. It was evident that [he/she/they] was not merely absorbing information but critically analyzing it.

One of [Student Name]’s strongest qualities is intellectual persistence. When faced with challenging problems, [he/she/they] does not look for shortcuts or superficial answers. Instead, [he/she/they] breaks the problem down, tests possibilities, and iterates patiently. I have seen [him/her/them] revisit ideas multiple times until achieving conceptual clarity. This resilience is essential for research, where progress often requires sustained engagement with uncertainty.

Equally notable is [his/her/their] intellectual humility. Despite strong ability, [Student Name] remains open to correction and actively seeks feedback. In collaborative settings, [he/she/they] contributes meaningfully while respecting others’ viewpoints. Peers often approach [him/her/them] for help, and [he/she/they] explains concepts clearly and patiently. This combination of independence and collaboration will serve [him/her/them] well in a rigorous research environment.

The Research Science Institute, administered by the Center for Excellence in Education and hosted at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, seeks students who show not only academic excellence but genuine research potential. Based on my years of observing [Student Name]’s development, I am confident that [he/she/they] possesses the analytical depth, maturity, and curiosity required to thrive in such an environment. [He/She/They] has already demonstrated the ability to grow beyond structured learning into independent exploration, which is precisely the mindset research demands.

I recommend [Student Name] without reservation. I am confident that [he/she/they] will take full advantage of the opportunity and contribute thoughtfully to the RSI community.

Sincerely,
[Teacher Name]
